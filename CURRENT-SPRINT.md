## 🤔 Questions & Considerations

1. **Database Schema:** Should we add any additional indexes or constraints based on expected query patterns?
2. **Stripe Integration:** Do we need immediate support for international payments, or focus on US-only initially?
3. **Design System:** Should we create our own component library or extend an existing one like Radix UI?
4. **Email Templates:** What's the complete list of transactional emails we'll need for MVP?
